## R Markdown

```{r summary}
summary(x)
```
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
for (i in c(60,33,51,27,17,24)) {
  print(densityplot(as.matrix(x)[,paste("P[",toString(i),"]",sep="")], xlab = paste("Mortality Rate (%) [",d[i,"Group.1"], "]")))
}
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
